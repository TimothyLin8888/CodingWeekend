This is a journal to document me making each project:

9/22/2024 - Created the ProjectRandomizer to start working on small projects during the weekends
            Created lots of functions and a list of projects to add
            (Created this txt file on 9/28/2024 so not much to say here, just here to document when I made this)

9/28/2024 - Created additional functions like completed so I can complete projects with dates on when I completed them
            Today's Project: Personal Finance Tracker (How do I that actually)
            Did a lot of research on Finance and wrote down notes on what do add to my FinanceTracker
            I started writing down the code like the basics like getIncome or setIncome those things
