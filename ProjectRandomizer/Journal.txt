This is a journal to document me making each project:

9/22/2024 - Created the ProjectRandomizer to start working on small projects during the weekends
            Created lots of functions and a list of projects to add
            (Created this txt file on 9/28/2024 so not much to say here, just here to document when I made this)

9/28/2024 - Created additional functions like completed so I can complete projects with dates on when I completed them
            Today's Project: Personal Finance Tracker (How do I that actually)
            Did a lot of research on Finance and wrote down notes on what do add to my FinanceTracker
            I started writing down the code like the basics like getIncome or setIncome those things
            
9/29/2024 - Did majority of the FinanceTracker and got rid of lots of things like getIncome and added getDescription
            and getDate since that's used more. I mainly used this project to practice using OOP. Of course it could
            be perfected more. I really didn't want this as one of the very first ones I'll be honest but probablity
            said otherwise.

10/5/2024-10/6/2024 - Didn't work on coding weekend due to Data Structures Project.

10/11/2024-10/12/2024 - Didn't work on coding weekend, fall break so I wanted to focus on a bigger project for the longer break.

10/19/2024 - Got create a Weather App. I got the key for a Weather API and started learning on how to actually use the API.
             I watched a YouTube video on how it works and got great results so far. I will continue to do it in order to make a
             better Weather App.

10/20/2024 - Created a cool while loop to be able to choose on what to see. I put more into the weather app so that I could have 
             the wind directions and have have the temperature changes if you want F or C. It is an interesting in how APIs work.
             I found this one to be more fun due to having not make it look so basic. Though it is pretty basic, I like this better
             than the Java Personal Finance Tracker so much more.

10/26/2024 - Participated in a Lucid Programming Competition so no time to do programmming

10/27/2024 - Was working on a Data Structures Project so I also had no time on this day too. But I will next weekend.

11/2/2024  - The Randomizer chose Flashcards. I played out on how I can implement the flashcards in the way I think I can make it work.

11/3/2024  - I implemented the Flashcards. I made it so you can create/add/edit/start flashcards. I put in my own presidents flashcards I made
             back in 2021. I made it so you have the ability to quit out of the flashcards at anytime.
             This one is the my favorite assignment I assigned myself this coding weekend. It made me think on how I want to do things.
             I spent a day to figure out how I was going to do it and I got everything I wanted in it.

11/16/2024 - On the randomizer, I got a calculator. I spent today experimenting tkinter since I have never used it before. I made a lot of progress.
             I made tkinter_notes.py to help me figure out on how I can use it to make something. I started working on the calculator gui.

11/17/2024 - I add the square root and exponents and made funny jokes for this calculator with a normal distribution that doesn't work. At some point I
             This was a great practice for me to learn on how tkinter works so it wasn't a complete waste of time. This has been a really enjoyable process.
