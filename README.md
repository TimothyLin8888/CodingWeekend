# CodingWeekend
Whenever I have the time on the weekends, I build small projects that I randomize in the ProjectRandomizer. The current project names are in the ProjectRandomizer folder in the ProjectLists txt file.

Some Projects I worked on:
   -Weather App
   -Flashcards

I am allowed to use any programming language I want but I like programming in Python since I want to use Python more. But depending on what I want to practice, I will change it up.

After I complete a project, I put the project into the CompletedProjectLists txt file in the ProjectRandomizer folder with the date I completed it.
