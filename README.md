# CodingWeekend

Welcome to my weekend project repository! This is where I document my journey of building small projects to sharpen my programming skills.

## What does it mean?
This repository is dedicated to weekend coding adventures, where I take on small projects to explore new concepts, improve my coding skills, and experiment with various programming languages.

### Some Projects I worked on:
   - Weather App - An application that fetches the current weather from an API based off of the user's input.
   - Flashcards - Is able to create, edit, and review flashcards for those that wants to review. Can be in order or random.

## Project Randomizer
The ProjectRandomizer  selects projects at random from a  list to help me challenge myself with unexpected topics.

I enjoy experimenting with various programming languages, so this is a place where I can experiment with different languages but I focus a lot on Python to deepen my expertise.

Completed projects are documented in the CompletedProjectLists.txt file located in the ProjectRandomizer folder, along with the date they were completed.

## What's Next?
Check back regularly to see new projects as they are added! Feel free to explore the repository and reach out with feedback or suggestions.
